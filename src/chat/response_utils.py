    The model is trained on short third-person observations but can run past its
    own turn and start speaking as another participant. Trim that hallucinated
    continuation *without* discarding legitimate multi-line answers — the old
    ``text.split("\\n")[0]`` truncation threw away everything after the first
    newline, so any multi-sentence answer was silently lost from history and the
    interaction log.

    Behaviour:
      1. Strip an echoed leading speaker label on the first line (e.g. the model
         prefixing its answer with ``"Kaya Bot:"`` or ``"<user>:"``).
      2. Cut at the first line where the model starts a *new user turn*
         (``"<user>:"``, ``"User:"``, ``"Utilizador:"``) — a hallucinated
         continuation — while preserving every line before it.
